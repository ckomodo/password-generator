# password-generator

This is my first real JS project to work on. It was very difficult getting everything together in place but I'm glad I did this. In this password generator, a user is prompted
for the length of password he/she wants. This is followed by a series of "confirm" asking the user for their preference in the characters to include in the password. Finally, the password is displayed with the appropriate length and characters.
